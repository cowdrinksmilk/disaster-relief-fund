## Known bugs and disclaimers
(It may be the case that your implementation is not perfect.)

Document any known bug or nuisance.
If any shortcomings, make clear what these are and where they are located.

## How to test it

The Maven build script provides hooks for run unit tests and generate code coverage
reports in HTML.

To run tests on all tiers together do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test jacoco:report`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

To run tests on a single tier do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test-compile surefire:test@tier jacoco:report@tier` where `tier` is one of `controller`, `model`, `persistence`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{controller, model, persistence}/index.html`

To run tests on all the tiers in isolation do this:

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@tests-and-coverage`
2. To view the Controller tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
3. To view the Model tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
4. To view the Persistence tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_API_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`

*(Consider using `mvn clean verify` to attest you have reached the target threshold for coverage)
